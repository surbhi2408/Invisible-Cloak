### Invisible-Cloak
This is an Invisible Cloak created using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation.
I have used red cloth here. We can use any other color of cloth.

# Algorithm:
<ol type="1">
  <li> Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ] </li>
  <li> Detect the given colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm. </li>
  <li> Segment out the given colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ] </li>
  <li> Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. </li>
